# self-driving-car

This is a simple project done with Codecademy. I've used **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and **Git**.

## Overview
Self-driving cars are set to be the next revolution in the automotive industry. The idea is simple: create a vehicle that can see the world and react to it as a human driver would, but the implementation is fraught with obstacles. You are tasked with creating a program that will allow a car to react to obstacles in the road.

To accomplish this, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of TypeScript object types to apply types to a variety of classes, properties, and methods.
